Secrets to Share
================

Share a secret (secretly, of course) with others.  Post a secret with or without an image.

We use a scroll view and change the contentsize programatically depending on whether or not an image is shared (moving everything below the image down the appropriate distance).

Uses:

* Core Data
* Mobile Core Services
* UIImagePicker
* Scroll View
* Gesture Recognizer
* Singleton 'store' for creating and fetching secrets
* UITableView
